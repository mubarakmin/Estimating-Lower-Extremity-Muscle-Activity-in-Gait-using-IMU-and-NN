The original data is from open access database by [J. Camargo, et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiomech.2021.110320)

The results of the journal titled, Estimation of Lower Extremity Muscle Activity in Gait Using the Wearable Inertial Measurement and Neural Network, are uploaded here.

To plot out the results please run the Jupyter file [plot.ipynb](https://github.com/mubarakmin/Estimating-Lower-Extremity-Muscle-Activity-in-Gait-using-IMU-and-NN/blob/main/plot.ipynb).

## Before you run

Make sure to change the variables by editing the block below:

```python
## Change Variables here
file_name = 'unseen' #'test' #'unseen'
# Plot from this gait number
# test max gait 303
# unseen max gait 302
select = 124 
num_gait = 5 # Number of gaits to plot in one diagram
```

Note that for variable *select* maximum value is 302.
